# php_UsingDataFromDb
Training exercises using PHP and manipulating data from DataBase. I was doing in portuguese but the way that I wrote this code is very simple to understand what happen in all steps.

I just post my exercises using Database and PHP,
with this code you will be able to see and manipulate your data with PHP.

I wrote in portuguese but is very simple to understand what happen and what I use to each step,
I also wrote the folders name with what actions they should do.

Thanks!
